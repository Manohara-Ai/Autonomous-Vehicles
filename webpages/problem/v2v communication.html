        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication</b> is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, allowing vehicles to communicate in real-time about road conditions, hazards, and traffic situations. By utilizing protocols like <b>Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)</b> and <b>Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)</b>, V2V enhances vehicle safety, traffic flow, and overall driving efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            V2V communication enables vehicles to transmit important information about their speed, position, road conditions, and other relevant data. This real-time exchange of information helps vehicles make informed decisions and coordinate actions, reducing the likelihood of accidents and optimizing traffic flow.

    <!-- DSRC Section -->
    <section id="dsrc" class="content-section">
        <h2>Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)</b> is a communication protocol developed specifically for automotive use. Operating in the <b>5.9 GHz</b> frequency band, DSRC enables low-latency, high-speed communication between vehicles over short distances (up to 1,000 meters). This technology is essential for V2V communication because it allows vehicles to exchange real-time data about road conditions, traffic, and other vehicles in the vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            DSRC works by enabling vehicles to send and receive information about their speed, location, and direction, providing a highly responsive network that improves traffic safety and efficiency. It supports applications such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <b>Real-time collision warnings and hazard alerts.</b><br>
            <b>Traffic signal priority for emergency vehicles.</b><br>
            <b>Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) for vehicle platooning.</b><br>
            <b>Intersection management to reduce accidents and congestion.</b><br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            One of the standout features of DSRC is its <b>low latency</b>, which enables immediate transmission of crucial safety information between vehicles. For example, if a vehicle detects a sudden obstacle, it can instantly send a warning to nearby vehicles, allowing them to take evasive actions and avoid collisions.
        </p>

    <!-- C-V2X Section -->
    <section id="cv2x" class="content-section">
        <h2>Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)</b> is a newer, advanced communication technology that leverages cellular networks (4G/5G) to enable broader connectivity between vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users. C-V2X allows vehicles to communicate not only with each other but also with infrastructure such as traffic lights, road signs, and cloud services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike DSRC, which uses short-range communication, C-V2X offers both <b>direct communication</b> (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure) and <b>network-based communication</b> (vehicle-to-cloud, vehicle-to-pedestrian). This allows vehicles to communicate over much longer distances and with a wider range of devices, including pedestrians and cyclists using smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main advantages of C-V2X include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <b>Wider coverage due to the use of existing cellular infrastructure, enabling communication over longer distances.</b><br>
            <b>Improved security and reliability with integration into the existing 4G/5G networks, ensuring low-latency communication even in complex environments.</b><br>
            <b>Better scalability for connecting large numbers of vehicles and infrastructure components seamlessly.</b><br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            C-V2X is crucial for the future of autonomous vehicles because it enables <b>real-time, low-latency communication</b> with a wider ecosystem, improving the ability to make informed decisions and optimize vehicle movement.

    <!-- V2I Section -->
    <section id="v2i" class="content-section">
        <h2>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)</b> communication is another key technology that enables autonomous vehicles to interact with road infrastructure, such as traffic signals, road signs, and other smart infrastructure elements. V2I communication enhances the ability of vehicles to make real-time decisions based on the status of the infrastructure, leading to safer and more efficient driving experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            V2I communication allows vehicles to receive information about traffic light cycles, road closures, construction zones, and other critical infrastructure data. This exchange of information enables vehicles to adjust their routes and speeds accordingly, improving traffic flow and reducing the risk of accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key benefits of V2I include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <b>Traffic signal optimization:</b> Vehicles can adjust their speeds based on the timing of traffic lights, reducing the need for stop-and-go driving and improving traffic flow.<br>
            <b>Construction zone alerts:</b> Real-time updates from infrastructure can inform vehicles of upcoming construction zones, helping to reroute traffic and reduce congestion.<br>
            <b>Road condition monitoring:</b> Vehicles can receive alerts about road hazards, such as icy patches or flooded areas, allowing drivers to take appropriate action.<br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By integrating V2I into the broader V2X ecosystem, autonomous vehicles can make more informed decisions, improving both safety and traffic efficiency.
