# Autonomous Vehicle Ideas Hub

Welcome to the **Autonomous Vehicle Ideas Hub**! We are a group of three Computer Science and Engineering students from RV College of Engineering (RVCE) working on a Design Thinking Lab (DTL) project aimed at brainstorming ideas for challenges in the autonomous vehicles field.

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring concepts, conducting simulations, and gathering insights to enhance the functionality and safety of autonomous systems. We aim to provide a collaborative platform for students, researchers, and enthusiasts to share ideas and contribute to the future of transportation.

## Objectives
- **Brainstorming Ideas:** Generate and discuss creative solutions to various challenges in the autonomous vehicle domain.
- **Simulations:** Explore and simulate concepts to visualize potential outcomes and improvements.
- **Community Collaboration:** Encourage contributions and discussions from like-minded individuals.

## How to Contribute
We invite everyone to contribute by participating in the survey available on our website. Your insights and feedback will help shape our ideas and solutions. Here’s how you can get involved:
1. **Visit our Website:** Access the survey linked on our homepage.
2. **Complete the Survey:** Share your thoughts and experiences related to autonomous vehicles.
3. **Engage with Us:** Feel free to reach out via email for discussions or further contributions.
